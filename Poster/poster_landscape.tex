  \headerbox{Real-Time Win Probability Modeling with Twitter}{name=abstract,column=0,row=0,span=2}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  This project investigates the predictive power of Twitter data in modeling the outcomes and events
  in NCAA March Madness basketball games. As a platform designed for instant reactions, rather
  than publishing long-term opinions, one would expect useful information about the qualitative
  progress of a sporting event to be derivable from a dataset of tweets. We extend previous work that used only data
  collected in advance of games to make predictions about games, instead
  collecting live-action time series of tweets in-game. In preliminary investigation,
  we find correlations between volumes of tweets and number of events recorded 
  in a game (rebounds, points scored, out of bounds) as well as between volumes
  of tweets and changes in game margin (one team moves farther ahead). 

  }
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Data Collection}{name=collection,column=0,below=abstract}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Our dataset compiles approximately 1 million tweets from
    42 games during the NCAA March Madness. For each game, 
    we compiled hashtags relevant to the game, which we
    then used to collect tweets via the Streaming API. 
    An set of example hashtags is: 
    \begin{center}
    \#MarylandvsHawaii \#WeWill \#Maryland \#Terrapins \#RainbowWarriors \#Hawaii \#HawaiiMBB \#RoadWarriors \#GoBows
    \end{center}

   \textbf{Predicting Game Events with Tweet Volumes. }
   The chart above plots time series of z-scored tweet volumes and z-scored
   changes in game margins to explore whether we can use tweets, even
   naively, to predict minutes in the game that will bring large changes
   in the score. The plot above provides evidence that, while the fit
   is clearly imperfect, we can derive information about game proceedings
   using no prior information except the volumes of tweets recorded in a game. 

   This initial finding leaves room for significant improvement
   after incorporating sentiment scores and a more intelligent
   predictive model.

    {\bf Event volumes track tweet volumes.} A preliminary linear regression demonstrated a statistically significant
    relationship between volumes of tweets in a given minute and the 
    number of in-game events that took place during that minute in the
    game. This result provides heuristic confirmation that tweets should
    could reflect qualitative changes in, for example, momentum.

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Sentiment classification for tweets forms a central pivot point for this 
    project. To perform classification, we train a bag-of-words
    mdoel with a labeled training corpus of 4000 tweets and a 
    linear-kernel Support Vector Machine. The classifier successfully identifies
    conventionally positive tweets but does not always capture 
    tweets that are idiomatically positive towards sports teams.

    The major piece of remaining work for the scope of this project is to investigate the
    relationship between sentiment classifications and changes in-game. We plan also 
    to benchmark the sentiment probability model against the industry-standard real-time probability model,
    which is based on historical data. We hope to apply a Hidden Markov Model to model the sequence
    of lead changes that take place during a game, as well as to model the likeliest overall winner
    at each time period during the game.

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Sentiment in this setting is much less meaningful without relating the sentiment
    contained in a tweet to one of the two teams. We therefore perform some
    heuristic classification of the relevance of a tweet to each team.

    We base classification on the hashtags that were originally used
    to collect the tweets and off of rosters. To treat rosters uniformly,
    we included that listed last names for each of the 7 top players by playing time
    for each team, as well as the last name of the head coach, with all data from ESPN.

    Tweets that were classified for both teams required tie-breaking, which we 
    implement by choosing the first term to appear.
